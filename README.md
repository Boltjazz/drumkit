# Drumkit Project

## Overview

This is a basic JavaScript project where I created a virtual drumkit. The goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with **JavaScript** and learn how to manipulate the **DOM (Document Object Model)**. I also explored how to add simple animations to make the application more interactive and engaging.

You can see a live demo of the drumkit [here](https://boltjazz.github.io/drumkit/).

## Features

- **Interactive Drum Sounds**: Each key on the keyboard corresponds to a different drum sound. Pressing a key plays the associated sound.
- **Visual Feedback**: When a key is pressed, the corresponding drum button is highlighted, giving visual feedback to the user.
- **Animations**: Applied basic animations using CSS and JavaScript to enhance the user experience.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Understanding the DOM

- **Selecting Elements**: I learned how to select elements in the DOM using methods like `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`.
- **Event Listeners**: I explored how to add event listeners to DOM elements to capture user interactions like key presses.
- **Manipulating Classes**: Learned how to add, remove, and toggle CSS classes using `classList`, which allowed me to create dynamic visual changes in response to user inputs.

### 2. Working with Audio in JavaScript

- I integrated audio playback into the project using the HTML `<audio>` element and controlled it via JavaScript.
- I learned how to trigger sound effects based on user inputs by linking each key to a corresponding drum sound.

### 3. Adding Animations

- **CSS Transitions**: Implemented simple transitions using CSS to create smooth animations when drum buttons are pressed.
- **JavaScript for Animation**: Used JavaScript to add and remove classes dynamically, triggering animations in response to user actions.

## How to Run the Project
